!Important Changes in LyX 2.4.0


!!Interface changes

* It is now possible to cancel background export processes. A menu entry
  to do so will appear on the Document menu when such a process is underway.
  The LFUN for this is export-cancel. One can also click on the 'spinner'
  to cancel export.

* The items on the Edit menu have been reordered, and many of the shortcuts
  have been changed so that they are more intuitive in the case of often
  used items. We understand that this may frustrate some users and apologize,
  while noting that menu shortcuts can always be customized by copying the
  stdmenus.inc file to the user directory and editing it.

* Backspace will now merge paragraphs even when they have different layouts.

* Ctrl-click on a cross-reference will now take you to its label.

* Default shortcuts for saving bookmarks have been changed to Alt-NUM, where
  NUM is the number of the bookmark. (They were previously Shift-F1, etc.) 

* This allows Shift-F3 to be used for word-find-backwards (i.e., find previous)
  on Linux and Windows.

* The shortcut for word-find on OSX is now Cmd-E, as is the Apple standard. The
  shortcut for word-find-previous is Cmd-G.

* Continuous spellcheck is now on by default, but only if the user does not have
  an existing preferences file. In that case, the old setting is preserved.


!!Documents compilation process and images conversion

* LyX now uses utf8 encoding per default for all languages. This does
  not affect existing documents. Note that LyX also does not touch
  personal defaults and templates. That is to say, if you still see
  traditional encoding preset for new documents, you can change that
  by selecting "Unicode (utf8) [default]" and hitting "Save as
  Documents Defaults" afterwards. Your personal templates need to be
  changed manually if desired.

* LyX defaults to the "HE8" LaTeX font encoding with Hebrew if the
  "Culmus" LaTeX fonts are installed.

* Documents that use TeX fonts can only be compiled with XeTeX if the input
  encoding is set to "utf8-plain" or "ascii".
  
* DocBook support has been revamped and now targets DocBook 5 (i.e. 
  only XML, SGML is gone). Some supporting files for the previous 
  implementation have been removed: all examples (lib/examples), 
  some layouts (existing documents should still work, but with a 
  DocBook 5 output instead of DocBook 4 SGML). The dependency on 
  sgmltools has been removed, this new support is always enabled.
  Having sgmltools installed or not will not change anything in LyX.

!!!The following pref variables were added in 2.4:

* \ct_additions_underlined true|false: determines whether additions in change tracking
  are underlined in the workarea (default: true).

* \ct_markup_copied true|false: determines whether change tracking markup should be
  preserved on copy/paste (default: false).

* \citation_search_view lyxpaperview: determines whether external script "lyxpaperview"
  should be used for looking up citation source.


!!!The following pref variables were changed in 2.4:



!!!The following pref variables are obsoleted in 2.4:

* \font_encoding
  The font encoding is now automatically set depending on the document
  fonts and languages.

* \use_qimage
  This is no longer necessary due to the rewrite of the painter.

* \use_pixmap_cacheqimage
  There is no evidence that this painting mode was useful anymore.

* \date_insert_format
  The function date-insert has been removed and superseded by info-insert date.
  The latter does not need a pref value anymore.


!!!The following new LyX functions have been introduced in 2.4:

* bidi is a helper function to implement icons that are different between LTR and RTL text. 

* buffer-reset-export advises LyX to remove the auxiliary files before doing the next
  export.

* buffer-write-as-template is a new convenience function to ease saving a document
  in the (personal) templates folder.

* export-cancel: Used to cancel background export processes.

* ifrelatives is a helper function to check whether a buffer has a master or children.

* lyxfiles-open opens the new examples or templates dialog.

* master-buffer-forall executes an lfun in the master and all children of a document.

* paragraph-select is a new convenience function to select the paragraph
  surrounding the actual cursor position.

* search-string-set [arg] stores the <arg>, the currently selected text or the word under
  cursor in the search cache that is used by word-find[-backward|-forward] if no argument
  is given to those.

* inset-split is a new convenience function that splits an inset into two at the given
  cursor position. This is only implemented for text insets currently.

* tabular-style-insert: Insert a table in a specified style.


!!!The following LyX functions have been changed in 2.4:

* set-graphics-group was renamed to graphics-set-group.

* info-insert buffer vcs-*: renamed to info-insert vcs *

* file-insert: optional second parameter "ignorelang" to make the insertion
  ignore the inserted file's main language (and rather adapt it to the insertion
  context's language).


!!!The following LyX functions have been removed in 2.4:

* date-insert: obsoleted by info-insert date.

!!!The following LyX function has been added and then removed in 2.4 development cycle.

* bidi: used as a first solution to provide icons that change
  direction with language.


!!!The following LyX documents have been moved in 2.4:

* As a result of a major restructuring of the templates and example
  directories, almost all examples and templates files have been renamed and
  moved to subfolders that reflect the layout category.
  The files now have much more decriptive (and longer) names, and they use
  URL encoding for specific special characters such as '(', ')' and '&'.
  Notably also the file that opens for new users has been renamed (from
  splash.lyx to Welcome.lyx).


!!!The following new folders have been added to the LyX directory

* The examples and templates directories have been completely re-organized.
  They are now much more structured (by means of layout categories) and thus
  consist of many new subfolders. 



!!!The following preferences files have been removed from the tarball in 2.4:



!!!The following metadata files have been added to the tarball in 2.4:



!!Changes with respect to external programs and libraries in 2.4:

* The Qt5 libraries are now used by default. In order to link against
  Qt4 the configure option --disable-qt5 has to be used.

* The dependency on pplatex/dvipost was dropped.

* The dependency on sgmltools was dropped, see DocBook 5 section.

!!! Dependencies to generate ePub files:

* The DocBook XSLT 1.0 style sheets are a required dependency to generate
  ePub files. All versions since 1.76.0 are supported. Version 1.79.2 is
  bundled with LyX.

* XSLT processor is needed, two options were successfully tested
  a) xsltproc
     - Works on Linux and OSX (tested with xsltproc 1.1.32).
     - Fails on Windows.
  b) Saxon
     - Tested on Linux, OSX and Windows.
     - Java is a required dependency. Any JVM for Java 1.4 should be supported.
     - Only Saxon versions 6.5.4 and 6.5.5 are supported.
     - Version 6.5.5 is bundled with LyX.


!!Known issues in version 2.4.0

* See http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome


!!Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 2.4.x

* Autotools monolithic build option for building LyX binaries was removed,
  for compilation speedup use parallel building on multiple cores instead.

* Several ttf fonts (esint10.ttf, stmary10.ttf, wasy10.ttf) were changed
  to reflect the fact that newer Qt libraries do not support displaying certain
  codepoints anymore (bug #8493, #10161). 
  Distribution packagers need to repack those font files in case they are
  delivering the fonts as a separated package dependent from core LyX
  in order to display correctly math symbols like \oint.

  Also note, that while it is still possible to compile LyX against Qt 4
  these math symbols will not be displayed correctly anymore on Qt 4.

!! If upgrading from a LyX version before 2.3.0
