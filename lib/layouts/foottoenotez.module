#DescriptionBegin
#Sets all footnotes as endnotes. This uses the enotez package
#which is more powerful and customizable than then endnotes package
#(module 'Footnotes as Endnotes (Basic)'), but requires a fairly modern
#LaTeX distribution (with LaTeX3).You will need to add an
#endnotes list (Insert > List/Contents/References > Endnotes) where you
#want the endnotes to appear.
